- 🧠 My multidisplinary skillset is a unqiue hybridization of **AI/ML, Human Factors & Cognitive Engineering, Holisitic UX** and **Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction**. One part technical. One part design. With both spectrums harmonizing atop the other.

- ❤️ My domains of interest include **Conversational AI (NLP/NLU), Generative Adversarial Networks, Quantum Machine Learning, Ambient Computing** and **Neuromorphic Engineering**

- 🔥 In May 2023, I launched **black dream ai** - A Generative + Adversarial Machine Intelligence startup purposed to formally explore + leverage my expertise in the above areas to ultimately commoditize them via impactful, disruptive products. Currenty working on a first-of-its kind, human-machine invented Quantum-ready programming language for Neuromorphic Computing called **Converge**. The primary purpose of Converge being to architect resiliency into Neuromorphic systems by forecasting + fashioning attack vectors and methods based on disordered neurologicial phenomena (skitzophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette's syndrome, etc.) 

- 🎓 I'm a self-taught, degree-less, college dropout of **Stevens Institute of Technology** in Hoboken, New Jersey 🇺🇸
