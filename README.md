![Hey there!](https://media.tenor.com/acihnolEVYAAAAAC/goku-hi.gif)

Hey I'm Eros. Self-taught programmer + software designer currently exploring the edge of machine learning, quantum computing, and neural interfaces.  

## Current Interests

- **Quantum Neural Engineering**  
  Merging QML with neural signal decoding. Hybrid classicalâ€“quantum models for EEG and BCI systems.

- **Hybrid Intelligence Interfaces**  
  Systems where biological and synthetic cognition co-evolve into augmentative, utilitarian interfaces.

- **Synthetic Intuition Engines**  
  Building the models that think before you think; mot just pattern recognition, but pre-conscious modeling for real ambient computing.

## Toolchain

- Python, PyTorch. JAX 
- PennyLane, Qiskit, Tensoorflow Quantum
- Git, Bash, Jupyter, VS Code  
- Hugging Face, ONNX, NumPy, SciPy
- Neurosity Crown, Upside Down Labs BioKit  

## Notables

- Built conversational AI before it was a buzzword (Samsung, Apple, Meta, Salesforce) 
- Organzued + held the first Silicon Valley Neurotech Forumn meetup at NASA Ames
- Currently based at NASA Ames Research Park, Moffett Field, California
