- 🧠 My multidisplinary skillset is a unqiue hybridization of **AI/ML, Human Factors & Cognitive Engineering, Technical UX/UI** and **Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction**. One part technical. One part design. With both spectrums harmonizing atop the other.

- 🦾 I've worked on AI @ **Apple, Salesforce, Samsung + ServiceNow**. I'm now currently working on Generative AI @ **Meta (Facebook)**.

- ❤️ My domains of interest include **Conversational AI (NLP/NLU), Generative Adversarial Networks, Quantum Machine Learning, Ambient Computing** and **Neuromorphic Engineering**

- 🔥 In May 2023, I launched **black dream ai** - A Generative + Adversarial Machine Intelligence startup purposed to formally explore + leverage my expertise in the above areas to ultimately commoditize them via impactful, disruptive products. 

- 🎓 I'm a self-taught, degreeless college dropout of **Stevens Institute of Technology** (Hoboken, New Jersey 🇺🇸) My college professor told me he didn't see me ever inventing anything, so I dropped out and now am worth 20x more than him at a fraction of the age.
